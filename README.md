<h2>Lab 3: Live Migration</h2>

<ul>

 <li>After practicing some basic scripts, you shall obtain some basic senses on control the environment using your code</li>

 <li>Now it is time to do super cool, or as French would say, suber cool, things</li>

 <li>Migrating docker images and doing it lively</li>

</ul>

<h2>Goal for Lab 3</h2>

<ul>

 <li>Objectives:</li>

 <li>Understanding the basic techniques for VM migration</li>

 <li>Using docker container as an example to test your migration skill</li>

 <li>Understanding the concept of checkpoint and restore</li>

 <li>Successfully migrate your image from one host to another</li>

 <li>Writing a decent report</li>

</ul>

<h2>To Start</h2>

<ul>

 <li>Learn to do live migration in docker</li>

 <li>Using Checkpoint and Restore (CRIU) tool in docker to do this job</li>

 <li><a href="https://criu.org/Live_migration">https://criu.org/Live_migration</a> is your source to check</li>

 <li>Ask one of our friend/roommate and migrate your Golang job (with your ID or name) to his/her place</li>

 <li>Measure the duration of migration and collect all other runtime statistics</li>

</ul>

<h2>Hints and Remarks</h2>

<ul>

 <li>It is a fairly easy experiment to test, thus please do your best to finish on your own</li>

 <li>DO NOT copy othersâ€™ words since it will not work anyway</li>

 <li>If I found out duplicated submission from two individuals, you may guess what would happen</li>

 <li>CRIU tool is your best way to make it happen or you may implement your own code to do it</li>

 <li>More information can be found in docker-engine maillist and GitHub issues</li>
